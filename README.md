`doctor` checks a local OCaml development environment and reports common setup
problems. It is read-only: it prints diagnostics and suggested commands, but it
does not modify opam switches, shell files, or editor settings.

It currently checks platform details, core tool versions, opam initialization
state, active and available switches, whether the resolved `ocaml` appears to
match the active switch, selected opam packages, and the VS Code OCaml Platform
extension when `code` is available.

## Installation

```console
opam update
opam install doctor
```

To build from a checkout:

```console
git clone https://github.com/funwithcthulhu/doctor
cd doctor
opam install . --deps-only --with-test
opam exec -- dune build
```

For local testing through opam, use a path pin:

```console
opam pin add doctor . -y --kind=path
```

## Usage

```console
doctor check
doctor check --format json
doctor version
doctor --help
```

`doctor check` prints a text report:

```console
$ doctor check
OCaml Doctor

[OK] platform detected: macOS
[OK] opam found: 2.2.1
[OK] OCaml found: 5.2.0
[OK] dune found: 3.17.0
[OK] OCaml LSP found: 1.19.0 (ocamllsp)
[WARN] ocamlformat not installed
       Suggested fix: opam install ocamlformat
[OK] active switch: 5.2.0
[WARN] VS Code OCaml Platform extension not detected
       Suggested fix: Install extension ocamllabs.ocaml-platform in VS Code.

Summary: 6 OK, 2 WARN, 0 ERROR
```

For tools that need structured output:

```console
$ doctor check --format json
{
  "diagnostics": [
    {
      "id": "platform.os",
      "severity": "ok",
      "title": "platform detected: macOS",
      "detail": null,
      "suggestion": null
    }
  ],
  "summary": { "ok": 1, "warn": 0, "error": 0 },
  "exit_code": 0
}
```

`doctor version` prints:

```console
doctor 0.1.0
```

## Exit Codes

- `0`: no warnings or errors
- `1`: one or more warnings, no errors
- `2`: one or more errors
- `3`: unexpected internal failure

## Development

```console
opam install . --deps-only --with-test
opam exec -- dune build
opam exec -- dune runtest
opam exec -- dune exec doctor -- check
```

Tests use injected process runners and deterministic fixtures. They do not
require opam to be initialized on the host machine, and they do not require VS
Code or a particular shell setup.

Maintainer release notes are in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).
