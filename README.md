`doctor` checks a local OCaml development environment. It reports missing tools,
suspicious opam state, and editor setup issues; it does not modify switches,
shell files, or editor settings.

It currently checks platform details, core tool versions, opam initialization
state, active and available switches, whether the resolved `ocaml` appears to
match the active switch, selected opam packages, and the VS Code OCaml Platform
extension when `code` is available.

## Installation

```console
opam update
opam install doctor
```

To build from a checkout:

```console
git clone https://github.com/funwithcthulhu/doctor
cd doctor
opam install . --deps-only --with-test
opam exec -- dune build
```

For local testing through opam, use a path pin:

```console
opam pin add doctor . -y --kind=path
```

## Usage

```console
doctor check
doctor check --format json
doctor version
doctor --help
```

`doctor check` prints a text report:

```console
$ doctor check
OCaml Doctor

[OK] platform detected: macOS
[OK] opam found: 2.2.1
[OK] OCaml found: 5.2.0
[OK] dune found: 3.17.0
[OK] OCaml LSP found: 1.19.0 (ocamllsp)
[WARN] ocamlformat not installed
       Suggested fix: opam install ocamlformat
[OK] active switch: 5.2.0
[WARN] VS Code OCaml Platform extension not detected
       Suggested fix: Install extension ocamllabs.ocaml-platform in VS Code.

Summary: 6 OK, 2 WARN, 0 ERROR
```

Use JSON when another program needs to read the report:

```console
$ doctor check --format json
{
  "diagnostics": [
    {
      "id": "platform.os",
      "severity": "ok",
      "title": "platform detected: macOS",
      "detail": null,
      "suggestion": null
    }
  ],
  "summary": { "ok": 1, "warn": 0, "error": 0 },
  "exit_code": 0
}
```

`doctor version` prints:

```console
doctor 0.1.0
```

## Exit Codes

- `0`: no warnings or errors
- `1`: one or more warnings, no errors
- `2`: one or more errors
- `3`: unexpected internal failure

## Development

```console
opam install . --deps-only --with-test
opam exec -- dune build
opam exec -- dune runtest
opam exec -- dune exec doctor -- check
```

Tests fake process execution, so they do not depend on the host opam setup, VS Code,
or a particular shell.

Maintainer release notes are in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).
